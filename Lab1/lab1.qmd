## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{bash}
uname -r
```
```{bash}
uname -a
```
```{bash}
lsb_release -a
```
```{bash}
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
```
```{bash}
dmesg | tail -n 30
```
```{r setup, include=TRUE}

```
